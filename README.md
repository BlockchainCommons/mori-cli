# Blockchain Commons `mori-cli`

<!--Guidelines: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/secure-template/wiki -->

### _by [Francisco Calder√≥n](https://github.com/grunch)_

Death is something uncomfortable, usually our death is not something we want to talk about, much less in our youth, but as Bitcoiners we have to prepare our funds for that day that will inevitably come.

This project proposes a way that a btc owner can leave his bitcoins to his heirs in the event of death in a decentralized way and with the least possible complication.

The main characteristic of this proposal is that the heirs can recover the funds in the event of death but CANNOT access the funds while the btc owner lives.

Not knowing when we are going to die is what adds complexity to the matter.

As a Bitcoiner and custodians of our privacy, we need to remove the trusted third party whenever possible.

Bitcoin script allows us to carry out a method so that the heirs cannot access while the btc owner is alive, but they will after his death.

## How does this work?
We will call the btc owner **Alice** and we will call the heir **Bob**:

1. User generates two descriptors, the first one is for Alice, with this descriptor Alice will be able to generate new addresses and spend those UTXO at any moment she need. The second one is for Bob, with this descriptor he will be able to spend every UTXO from Alice after 25920 blocks being mined, this is 6 months approximately.
2. Alicia gives to Bob his descriptor.
3. Alice can use this wallet like any other wallet, but she has to be sure to spend every UTXO before 6 months, if she doesn't we can assume she's dead and Bob can inherit the money.

**Mor√≠** is based on [Bitcoin Dev Kit](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk) and creates descriptors from a miniscript policy, this policy have two spending conditions, **this descriptors ONLY works on BDK at this moment** but hopefully it will be working on [Bitcoin core soon](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800) and others will follow.

Condition 1: Alice can spend the funds at any time.
Condition 2: Bob can spend the funds after N blocks have been mined.

miniscript policy:
```
or(
    pk(A),
    and(
        pk(B),
        older(N)
    )
)

```
## Status - Late Alpha

`Mor√≠`  is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

This first version is a stateless wallet, this means that we are regenerating it every time we run the command line.

### Roadmap
- [x] Basic stateless wallet (connects to a electrum server)
- [x] Add miniscripts support with CSV time-locks
- [x] Generate main descriptors (A can spend anytime, B can spend after N blocks mined)
- [x] Generate account addresses from descriptor main descriptor
- [x] Add PSBT generation, signing PSBT and broadcast tx
- [] Generate descriptors for B (can spend after N blocks mined)
- [] Error handling
- [] Change from stateless to stateful wallet

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed.

## Installation Instructions
```
$ git clone https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli.git
$ cd mori-cli
$ cargo build
```
The resulting executable is `target/debug/mori-cli`

You can alternatively run and build automatically with a single command: `cargo run`.

## Usage Instructions
We generate two descriptors, they only have a little difference, one will generate the addresses to receive and the other one for the change addresses.
```
$ cargo run -- descriptor
```
Everything before `--` are arguments we are passing to Rust's cargo tool, what is after to `--` are arguments to our program.

If we want to execute the binary we can run it like this:
```
$ target/debug/mori-cli descriptor
```
We will see our receiving descriptor and our change descriptor, as we are using a stateless wallet we need to pass as arguments those descriptors as parameters everytime, so let's create two variables in a .env file.
```
DESC="wsh(or_d(pk([f7e6924a/87h/1h/0h]tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPdoksgNYN6yy6JxCNTGnHGEcoKwiEM6z8i4v8kZEUzp3UC5LLypQT2mrRTW4Zo4jPTsPmzjTH8MPBTNsHQvbamfxmQRrfoDk/0/*),and_v(v:pk([aab88436/87h/1h/0h]tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPeoE3PXG3hRGDVnSV7fWgnUZ8yaG9JaSQBGqzGEXUyyxj5Dkp4xxbPUZzedjBSghLsoqfuUYukbit47dbkLT3PY3oRXViJGr/0/*),older(25920))))"
CHANGE="wsh(or_d(pk([f7e6924a/87h/1h/0h]tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPdoksgNYN6yy6JxCNTGnHGEcoKwiEM6z8i4v8kZEUzp3UC5LLypQT2mrRTW4Zo4jPTsPmzjTH8MPBTNsHQvbamfxmQRrfoDk/1/*),and_v(v:pk([aab88436/87h/1h/0h]tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPeoE3PXG3hRGDVnSV7fWgnUZ8yaG9JaSQBGqzGEXUyyxj5Dkp4xxbPUZzedjBSghLsoqfuUYukbit47dbkLT3PY3oRXViJGr/1/*),older(25920))))"
```
Now we bring those vars to our shell running `source .env`

To receiving you need to generate a new address, for this we need to pass the descriptor and a index, it starts with 0.
```
cargo run -- receive --index 0 --desc $DESC
```
Send some btc to that address, if you don't have tBTC you can get some from this [faucet](https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/).

To see your balance just run
```
cargo run -- balance --desc $DESC --change $CHANGE
```
Now you want to send some coins to a other user address, for this you need to `build` a transaction.
```
cargo run -- build --desc $DESC --change $CHANGE --amount <amount in satoshsi> --destination <tBTC address>
```
We will see a [PSBT](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/psbt.md) that we need to sign and broadcast with the `send` command.
```
cargo run -- send --desc $DESC --psbt <psbt transaction>
```
That should show you a transaction Id, that means that it works üòÄ Congratulations! you can die now! ‚ö∞Ô∏èü™¶‚ö±Ô∏èüíÄ

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.
